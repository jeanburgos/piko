In the midst of relocating to a new abode, I found myself facing the bittersweet task of dismantling my beloved Home Lab, the nexus of my networking and virtualization endeavors. Over time, it became apparent that my makeshift setup, with equipment precariously stacked atop one another, was far from optimal. Despite scouring the market for an affordable half rack enclosure to neatly house all my gear, my quest proved futile.

Undeterred, I opted for an open frame rack solution instead. This shift not only promised to streamline the organization of my equipment but also aimed to enhance the aesthetic appeal of my lab space. With this new arrangement, conducting experiments and tinkering with configurations would be both smoother and more visually pleasing.

Certainly! Documenting these projects is an integral aspect of my learning journey. These labs serve as invaluable hands-on experiences, enriching my understanding as I strive towards achieving the prestigious Cisco CCNP ENCOR certification.

## Here is some of the equipment I purchased recently for expanding my lab.
